# IRCv3

A simple [IRCv3](https://ircv3.net/irc/) command class.

**This is a library built specifically for [TopOTheHourBot](https://github.com/TopOTheHourBot/TopOTheHourBot), and should not be used in production code. This library has not been rigorously tested.**

## Installation

This library is available through [local](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/topics/local-project-installs/) or [VCS](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/topics/vcs-support/) installation only. VCS installation is recommended:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/TopOTheHourBot/ircv3.git
```

This will build and deploy the library onto your local system as if it were a library installed from PyPI. This library is knowingly unavailable through PyPI so as to discourage its use in production code.
